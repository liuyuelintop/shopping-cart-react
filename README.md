## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial provided by PedroTech and a GitHub repository by [machadop1407](https://github.com/machadop1407/shopping-cart-react). The core ideas and some parts of the code were adapted from these resources:

- [PedroTech YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEMrD9t85v4&t=2752s)
- [GitHub Source Code](https://github.com/machadop1407/shopping-cart-react)

## Core Concepts

The replication of the project was based on the following core ideas:

1. **Navbar Component**: Implementing a responsive navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate to different parts of the application and view the cart items count.
2. **Shop Component**: Creating a shop page that displays all the products available for purchase.
3. **ShopContext**: Establishing a context to manage and provide state throughout the application, particularly for handling the shopping cart logic.
4. **Cart and CartItem Components**: Developing the cart functionality that allows users to see their selected items, adjust quantities, and initiate the checkout process.
5. **Deployment with gh-pages**: Utilizing the `gh-pages` package to deploy the application to GitHub Pages for easy access and demonstration.

## Features
